## History

After setting up a WordPress WooCommerce site for a friends business ([Pxssyinferno.com](https://www.pxssyinferno.com/)) it was time to focus on the design.
The [Storefront](https://wordpress.org/themes/storefront/) theme was close to the design requirements of the new site.
The theme customization allows a non software engineer to make a range of changes to the themes.
After setting all these setting we only had a couple of design requirements that couldn't be resolved by changing the theme settings.

One option would be making changes directly in the theme code of Storefront.
Downside of this approach is that the changes will be overwritten when the theme is upgraded.
A better approach to customize an existing theme is using a technique called [Child Themes](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/).
This repository is a child theme that is based on Storefront.
